## Installation

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/blindstore/libshe.svg?branch=master)

```
# Install GMP
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

# Install nose
sudo pip install nose

# Recursively clone the repo
git clone --recursive git@github.com:blindstore/libshe.git`

# Build the library
cd libshe
make

# Run tests
make nosetests
```
=======
* clone repository recursively, because BitArray needs to be cloned as well: `git clone --recursive git@github.com:blindstore/libshe.git`
* `make` to compile it
* `make nosetests` to run tests of the library, they are done in Python, thus you need Nose installed


## Pre-requirements
* The GNU GMP library must be installed and included in your path. See: gmplib.org
Make sure to configure it as:
./configure --enable-cxx 
before making and installing.
